# Business Case for GitHub Enterprise and AI-Assisted Development Tools
## Ivey Business School EdTech Department

### Executive Summary

The Ivey EdTech Lab has successfully demonstrated the transformative potential of AI-assisted development through two production applications: **analogueAI** (educational concept cards platform) and **TeamAssessments** (faculty grading platform). These projects showcase what's possible with modern development tools but highlight critical limitations of free-tier platforms when handling institutional data and scaling team collaboration.

**Current State**: Two sophisticated educational platforms developed rapidly using Claude Code, hosted on free GitHub accounts, with production deployment on Render.

**Investment Need**: GitHub Enterprise, Claude Code Teams, and enterprise API access to support secure, scalable EdTech innovation.

**ROI**: Enable 10x faster educational tool development while meeting institutional security and compliance requirements.

## Critical Limitations of Current Free-Tier Setup

### Security Vulnerabilities

**analogueAI Risks:**
- API keys stored in environment variables without enterprise secret management
- Community interaction data stored without encryption
- No automated security scanning for dependencies or code vulnerabilities

**TeamAssessments Risks (CRITICAL):**
- Email credentials documented in plain text files (`EMAIL_SETUP.md`)
- Student assessment data and grades stored in JSON files without enterprise protection
- Faculty and external judge contact information in version control
- No audit logging for grade modifications or data access

### Collaboration Barriers

**Current State**: Single developer on personal GitHub account
- **No team access control** - cannot safely add faculty or staff collaborators
- **No organization management** - projects scattered across personal repositories
- **No standardized workflows** - inconsistent security policies and deployment practices
- **Limited private repositories** - sensitive institutional data mixed with public code

### Compliance Gaps

**FERPA Requirements**: Educational records must be handled with enterprise-grade security
**Institutional IT Standards**: Free tools don't meet Western University's security policies
**Professional Standards**: External partners and funding agencies expect enterprise infrastructure

## Risk Assessment

### Risks of Not Investing

**High Risk:**
- **Data Breach**: Student assessment data or faculty information compromised
- **Compliance Violation**: FERPA violations from inadequate security measures
- **Reputation Damage**: Public exposure of sensitive institutional data

**Medium Risk:**
- **Productivity Bottleneck**: Unable to add team members or scale development
- **Professional Perception**: Free tools undermine credibility with partners/funders
- **Innovation Limitation**: Cannot support multiple concurrent EdTech projects

**Opportunity Cost:**
- Other institutions investing in professional EdTech infrastructure
- Missing grant opportunities requiring enterprise-level development practices
- Faculty unable to collaborate effectively on educational technology initiatives

---

## Conclusion

The analogueAI and TeamAssessments projects demonstrate that Ivey EdTech Lab can rapidly develop sophisticated educational technology using AI-assisted development tools. However, the current free-tier infrastructure creates unacceptable security risks, limits team collaboration, and fails to meet institutional compliance requirements.

**GitHub Enterprise is not optionalâ€”it's essential** for:
1. **Protecting sensitive academic data** in systems like TeamAssessments
2. **Enabling team collaboration** on multiple EdTech initiatives
3. **Meeting institutional security and compliance standards**
4. **Supporting the department's mission** to innovate in educational technology

The $7,800 annual investment represents less than 20% of a single developer's salary while providing enterprise-grade infrastructure that enables the EdTech Lab to operate as a professional development organization, attract faculty collaboration, and secure external funding for educational innovation.

**Recommendation**: Approve GitHub Enterprise investment immediately to secure existing production systems and enable scaling of EdTech innovation at Ivey Business School.
